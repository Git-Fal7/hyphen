Takes about ~300megs of ram in arch using the full pkgbuild, compared to full xfce ~500megs.
this would help for lower-end computers as the amount of processess are minimal.

# TODO
- Replace Action Menu in panel for a logout launcher (maybe arcolinux-logout would work).

- Add a launcher.
- Use xdotool for panther_launcher.
- Modify keyboard settings.
- Modify lightdm-gtk-greeter config settings in full version.
- Add lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings for modifying lightdm-gtk-greeter.
